## About Me

I am a Data Scientist with experience in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, where I focus on building and deploying practical solutions. My primary strengths lie in NLP projects like ChatBots, Question Answering, and Summarization. In addition, I've explored various domains, including **Computer Vision**, **Speech Processing**, and **Time-Series Analysis**, gaining hands-on experience with tasks such as **audio data collection**, **cryptocurrency prediction**, and **video action detection**. While I am still growing my expertise in these fields, I am continuously learning and improving through challenging projects.
